Added granularity to the pause control mechanism allows governance to pause individual actions on specific markets,\n * which reduces impact on the protocol as a whole. This is particularly useful when applied to isolated pools.\n *\n * The goal of **Governance** is to increase governance efficiency, while mitigating and eliminating malicious or erroneous proposals.\n *\n * ## Details\n *\n * Governance has **3 main contracts**: **GovernanceBravoDelegate, XVSVault, XVS** token.\n *\n * - XVS token is the protocol token used for protocol users to cast their vote on submitted proposals.\n * - XVSVault is the main staking contract for XVS. Users first stake their XVS in the vault and receive voting power proportional to their staked\n * tokens that they can use to vote on proposals. Users also can choose to delegate their voting power to other users.\n *\n * # Governor Bravo\n *\n * `GovernanceBravoDelegate` is main Venus Governance contract. Users interact with it to:\n * - Submit new proposal\n * - Vote on a proposal\n * - Cancel a proposal\n * - Queue a proposal for execution with a timelock executor contract.\n * `GovernanceBravoDelegate` uses the XVSVault to get restrict certain actions based on a user's voting power. The governance rules it inforces are:\n * - A user's voting power must be greater than the `proposalThreshold` to submit a proposal\n * - If a user's voting power drops below certain amount, anyone can cancel the the proposal. The governance guardian and proposal creator can also\n * cancel a proposal at anytime before it is queued for execution.\n *\n * ## Venus Improvement Proposal\n *\n * Venus Governance allows for Venus Improvement Proposals (VIPs) to be categorized based on their impact and risk levels. This allows for optimizing proposals\n * execution to allow for things such as expediting interest rate changes and quickly updating risk parameters, while moving slower on other types of proposals\n * that can prevent a larger risk to the protocol and are not urgent. There are three different types of VIPs with different proposal paramters:\n *\n * - `NORMAL`\n * - `FASTTRACK`\n * - `CRITICAL`\n *\n * When initializing the `GovernorBravo` contract, the parameters for the three routes are set. The parameters are:\n *\n * - `votingDelay`: The delay in blocks between submitting a proposal and when voting begins\n * - `votingPeriod`: The number of blocks where voting will be open\n * - `proposalThreshold`: The number of votes required in order submit a proposal\n *\n * There is also a separate timelock executor contract for each route, which is used to dispatch the VIP for execution, giving even more control over the\n * flow of each type of VIP.\n *\n * ## Voting\n *\n * After a VIP is proposed, voting is opened after the `votingDelay` has passed. For example, if `votingDelay = 0`, then voting will begin in the next block\n * after the proposal has been submitted. After the delay, the proposal state is `ACTIVE` and users can cast their vote `for`, `against`, or `abstain`,\n * weighted by their total voting power (tokens + delegated voting power). Abstaining from a voting allows for a vote to be cast and optionally include a\n * comment, without the incrementing for or against vote count. The total voting power for the user is obtained by calling XVSVault's `getPriorVotes`.\n *\n * `GovernorBravoDelegate` also accepts [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) signatures for voting on proposals via the external function\n * `castVoteBySig`.\n *\n * ## Delegating\n *\n * A users voting power includes the amount of staked XVS the have staked as well as the votes delegate to them. Delegating is the process of a user loaning\n * their voting power to another, so that the latter has the combined voting power of both users. This is an important feature because it allows for a user\n * to let another user who they trust propose or vote in their place.\n *\n * The delegation of votes happens through the `XVSVault` contract by calling the `delegate` or `delegateBySig` functions. These same functions can revert\n * vote delegation by calling the same function with a value of `0`.\n */\ncontract GovernorBravoDelegate is GovernorBravoDelegateStorageV2, GovernorBravoEvents {\n    /// @notice The name of this contract\n    string public constant name = \"Venus Governor Bravo\";\n\n    /// @notice The minimum setable proposal threshold\n    uint public constant MIN_PROPOSAL_THRESHOLD = 150000e18; // 150,000 Xvs\n\n    /// @notice The maximum setable proposal threshold\n    uint public constant MAX_PROPOSAL_THRESHOLD = 300000e18; //300,000 Xvs\n\n    /// @notice The minimum setable voting period\n    uint public constant MIN_VOTING_PERIOD = 20 * 60 * 3; // About 3 hours, 3 secs per block\n\n    /// @notice The max setable voting period\n    uint public constant MAX_VOTING_PERIOD = 20 * 60 * 24 * 14; // About 2 weeks, 3 secs per block\n\n    /// @notice The min setable voting delay\n    uint public constant MIN_VOTING_DELAY = 1;\n\n    /// @notice The max setable voting delay\n    uint public constant MAX_VOTING_DELAY = 20 * 60 * 24 * 7; // About 1 week, 3 secs per block\n\n    /// @notice The number of votes in support of a proposal required in order for a quorum to be reached and for a vote to succeed\n    uint public constant quorumVotes = 600000e18; // 600,000 = 2% of Xvs\n\n    /// @notice The EIP-712 typehash for the contract's domain\n    bytes32 public constant DOMAIN_TYPEHASH =\n        keccak256(\"EIP712Domain(string name,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)\");\n\n    /// @notice The EIP-712 typehash for the ballot struct used by the contract\n    bytes32 public constant BALLOT_TYPEHASH = keccak256(\"Ballot(uint256 proposalId,uint8 support)\");\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Used to initialize the contract during delegator contructor\n     * @param xvsVault_ The address of the XvsVault\n     * @param proposalConfigs_ Governance configs for each governance route\n     * @param timelocks Timelock addresses for each governance route\n     */\n    function initialize(\n        address xvsVault_,\n        ProposalConfig[] memory proposalConfigs_,\n        TimelockInterface[] memory timelocks,\n        address guardian_\n    ) public {\n        require(address(proposalTimelocks[0]) == address(0), \"GovernorBravo::initialize: cannot initialize twice\");\n        require(msg.sender == admin, \"GovernorBravo::initialize: admin only\");\n        require(xvsVault_ != address(0), \"GovernorBravo::initialize: invalid xvs address\");\n        require(guardian_ != address(0), \"GovernorBravo::initialize: invalid guardian\");\n        require(\n            timelocks.length == uint8(ProposalType.CRITICAL) + 1,\n            \"GovernorBravo::initialize:number of timelocks should match number of governance routes\"\n        );\n        require(\n            proposalConfigs_.length == uint8(ProposalType.CRITICAL) + 1,\n            \"GovernorBravo::initialize:number of proposal configs should match number of governance routes\"\n        );\n\n        xvsVault = XvsVaultInterface(xvsVault_);\n        proposalMaxOperations = 10;\n        guardian = guardian_;\n\n        //Set parameters for each Governance Route\n        uint256 arrLength = proposalConfigs_.length;\n        for (uint256 i; i < arrLength; ++i) {\n            require(\n                proposalConfigs_[i].votingPeriod >= MIN_VOTING_PERIOD,\n                \"GovernorBravo::initialize: invalid min voting period\"\n            );\n            require(\n                proposalConfigs_[i].votingPeriod <= MAX_VOTING_PERIOD,\n                \"GovernorBravo::initialize: invalid max voting period\"\n            );\n            require(\n                proposalConfigs_[i].votingDelay >= MIN_VOTING_DELAY,\n                \"GovernorBravo::initialize: invalid min voting delay\"\n            );\n            require(\n                proposalConfigs_[i].votingDelay <= MAX_VOTING_DELAY,\n                \"GovernorBravo::initialize: invalid max voting delay\"\n            );\n            require(\n                proposalConfigs_[i].proposalThreshold >= MIN_PROPOSAL_THRESHOLD,\n                \"GovernorBravo::initialize: invalid min proposal threshold\"\n            );\n            require(\n                proposalConfigs_[i].proposalThreshold <= MAX_PROPOSAL_THRESHOLD,\n                \"GovernorBravo::initialize: invalid max proposal threshold\"\n            );\n            require(address(timelocks[i]) != address(0), \"GovernorBravo::initialize:invalid timelock address\");\n\n            proposalConfigs[i] = proposalConfigs_[i];\n            proposalTimelocks[i] = timelocks[i];\n        }\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Function used to propose a new proposal.
